//A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
//
//Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
//
//Write a function:
//
//public func solution(_ X : Int, _ Y : Int, _ D : Int) -> Int
//
//that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
//
//For example, given:
//
//  X = 10
//  Y = 85
//  D = 30
//the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
//
//after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
//after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
//after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
//Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
//
//X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
//X â‰¤ Y.
